# Data Visualization (Python)

This project contains multiple small python data visualization files that I gathered from my last year's (2020) work and learning projects. (Sensitive data has been covered, here only shows random data)

Each visualization file in this repository is independent. Therefore, no specific order should be followed.

This project contains following files (will updating): 
1. README file
2. Simple_Categorical_Heatmaps
3. Dragon_3D
4. Earth_Cities_3D
5. Undergrad_Travel
6. COVID_Volunteer
